Smart Screen — Python ML Project (Own Idea)

This repository contains a Python/ML project developed from an original idea: building a “Smart Screen” system (or a data-driven solution) using Python and machine learning components.

Project Overview

This project aims to:

Implement a machine-learning based solution using custom logic/data.

Process input data, apply data preprocessing, feature engineering, and build ML models.

Provide insight or predictions via scripts or notebooks included in the repository.

The goal is to demonstrate your own idea end-to-end: from raw data to ML-powered output.
